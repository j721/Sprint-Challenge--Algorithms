## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) Runtime complexity, the running time or space time will grow linearly (at the same rate) and in direct proportion to input size. Has one loop where n increases linearly.


b) Still O(n) for runtime complexity, even though there is a nested while loop it is only a comparison between n (input size) and not reiterating over it again. It only reiterates over n once with the for loop.


c) The runtime complexity is constant O(n). Recursion of n in a linear fashion. 

<!-- Still a little unsure whether O(n) or O(1) -->

<!-- As there is no looping in this function, even when recursion is being used what gets returned back i The runtime or space used remains constant even when the input size changes.  -->

## Exercise II

U

-f standing for limit, kind of like middle index between eggs being broken and not broken 
-want to find the lowest floor number, in which the number of eggs that have been dropped and then are broken will be minimized

-if thrown of of  f >= floor then eggs dropped will be broken
-if thrown of floor f < floor then eggs dropped will not be broken

P
-think about dividing our search to find f value in half, since f is kind of like the middle index. 
-use Binary Algorithm 

E
R
