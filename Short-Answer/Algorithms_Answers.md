## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) Runtime complexity, the running time or space time will grow linearly (at the same rate) and in direct proportion to input size. Has one loop where n increases linearly.


b) Still O(n) for runtime complexity, even though there is a nested while loop it is only a comparison between n (input size) and not reiterating over it again. It only reiterates over n once with the for loop.


c)

## Exercise II
