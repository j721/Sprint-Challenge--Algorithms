'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''


# U
#takes in word as parameter, must return a count (need a counter that will increment at +1)
#look for words that contain the "th" string
#going to assume word is similar to an array that has indices to be able to search for "th" within it

#use recursion to call the function within itself



# P

#for count, see if it could be passed in as a parameter and set to default of 0. To initialize the counter
#conditions to consider
#word needs at least the two letters "th"
#if the word contains less than or equal to 1 letter then just return back the empty count of 0

#if the word contains at least two letters, with th in its index then 
#return the count back incremented by count +1

# E
# R#


def count_th(word):
    
    # TBC
    
    pass
